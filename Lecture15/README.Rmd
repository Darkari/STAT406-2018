## Nearest neighbours

Probably simplest model-free estimator for conditional class probabilities (given 
values for the features). *Peer-pressure*. Akin to kernel regression, also suffers
from the *curse of dimensionality*. Factor or binary features need to be treated with
care.

## Classification Trees

Classification trees. Instead of RSS we use a measure of (in)homogeneity of classes
within leaves, partition to maximize the reduction in inhomogeneity.
