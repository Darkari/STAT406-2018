## What is Adaboost doing, *really*? 

We have seen in class that Adaboost can be thought of as 
fitting an *additive model* in a stepwise (greedy) way,
using an exponential loss. 
It is then easy to prove that Adaboost.M1 
is computing an approximation to the *optimal classifier*
G( x ) = log[ P( Y = 1 | X = x ) / P( Y = -1 | X = x ) ] / 2.
More specifically, Adaboost.M1 is fitting an 
additive model to that function, in other words is
attempting to find functions $f_1$, $f_2$, ..., $f_N$ such that 
$G(x) = \sum_i f_i( x )$. 

Knowing what function the boosting algorithm is approximating (albeit in 
a greedy and suboptimal way), allows us to   
understand when the algorithm is expected to work well,
and also when it may not work well. 
In particular, it provides one way to choose the complexity of the 
*weak lerners* used to construct the ensemble. For an example
you can refer to the corresponding lab activity. 

### A more challenging example, the `email spam` data

The email spam data set is a relatively classic data set 
containing 57 features (potentially explanatory variables) 
measured on 4601 email messages. The goal is to predict
whether an email is *spam* or not. The 57 features are 
a mix of continuous and discrete variables. More information
can be found at
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase).

We first load the data and randomly separate it into a training and
a test set. A more thorough analysis would be to use 
*full* K-fold cross-validation, but given the computational
complexity, I decided to leave the rest of this 
3-fold CV exercise to the reader. 
```{r spam.1, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data(spam, package='ElemStatLearn')
n <- nrow(spam)
set.seed(987)
ii <- sample(n, floor(n/3))
spam.te <- spam[ii, ]
spam.tr <- spam[-ii, ]
```
We now use Adaboost with 500 iterations, using *stumps* as our
weak learners / classifiers, and check the performance on
the test set:
```{r spam.2, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(adabag)
onesplit <- rpart.control(cp=-1, maxdepth=1, minsplit=0, xval=0)
bo1 <- boosting(spam ~ ., data=spam.tr, boos=FALSE, mfinal=500, control=onesplit)
pr1 <- predict(bo1, newdata=spam.te)
table(spam.te$spam, pr1$class)
```
The classification error rate on the test set is rather high. We now
compare it with that of a Random Forest:

```{r spam.3, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(randomForest)
set.seed(123) 
a <- randomForest(spam ~ . , data=spam.tr) # , ntree=500)
plot(a)
pr.rf <- predict(a, newdata=spam.te, type='response')
table(spam.te$spam, pr.rf)
```

The number of trees in the random forest seems to be appropriate, and its
performance on this test set is definitively better than that of 
boosting. Is there any *room for improvement* for Adaboost? 
As we discussed in class, depending on the interactions that may be 
present in the *true classification function*, we might be able to 
improve our boosting classifier by slightly increasing the complexity
of our base ensemble members. Here we try to use 3-split classification
trees, instead of the 1-split ones used above:
```{r spam.4, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
threesplits <- rpart.control(cp=-1, maxdepth=3, minsplit=0, xval=0)
bo3 <- boosting(spam ~ ., data=spam.tr, boos=FALSE, mfinal=500, control=threesplits)
pr3 <- predict(bo3, newdata=spam.te)
table(spam.te$spam, pr3$class)
```
There is, in fact, a noticeable improvement in performance on this
test set. The number of element on the boosting ensemble appears to be
appropriate:

```{r spam.5, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(errorevol(bo3, newdata=spam.te))
```

As mentioned above, you, dear reader, are encouraged to finish this analysis
by doing a complete 3-fold CV run in order to compare boosting with random 
forests on these data. 

## Gradient boosting

Discussed during the lecture. 

## Neural Networks

Discussed during the lecture. 

#### An example with a simple neural network

This example using the ISOLET data illustrates the use of simple
neural networks, and also highlights some issues of which it may 
be important to be aware.
